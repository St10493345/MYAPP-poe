In my final part for this project i took from the feedback and made the changes that was expected.
I removed the html that i used in part two and changed it to react native.
My implementation i made was correcting my mistakes.
To my Home page i made the page display the avarage price of the menu items that is broken down into the diffrent courses.
I also added a seperate screen and moved the adding of the menu items feture from the home page to the new page.
In the new page i made it so that the chef could be able to add and remove items from the menu.
Then i added a seperate page where the guest will be  able to filter the courses by what they are looking for.
I also added a navigation setup page to be able to see how you will navigate.
